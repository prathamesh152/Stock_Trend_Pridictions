# Stock_Trend_Pridictions
This project is a part of my self-learning project in the course Machine Learning at IIT Ropar. It is focused on predicting stock trends using a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) deep learning model, bringing a compelling dimension to time series analysis. The dataset sourced from Yahoo finance spanning 2010 -2023, encompasses stock opening, closing, high and low values.
